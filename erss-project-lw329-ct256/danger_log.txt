1. web static file loading path needs to take care. Because, this project uses
lots of pictures for the frontend, and sometimes it would report errors that said
it could not find the correct static file, like pictures or css. Then we figure out 
that we need to configure static file path in the settings.py.

2. Database picture store problem. At first, I thought database would store the picture
in a binary format. However, I found that the database actually stored the pciture' path 
name. 

3. Frontend send POST request must attack CSRF token. Otherwise, the backend of Django 
would report missing CSRF token.

4. Proto acks and seq number problem. Both amazon server and world server must send ack, and 
seq number to make sure the request has been recevied.
